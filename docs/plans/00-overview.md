# Streamline — Plan Overview

> **For Claude:** Read this file FIRST. Then read ONLY the epic file you need next. Do NOT load all epic files at once — they are chunked to preserve context window.
>
> **Coding conventions are in `CLAUDE.md` at repo root.** Follow them exactly.

**Goal:** Build a live streaming orchestration platform that ingests, transcodes, packages, and serves video — demonstrating domain expertise in live video infrastructure with Go, ConnectRPC, Kafka, and Kubernetes.

**Architecture:** Control plane (Stream Manager, Pipeline Controller, API Service) orchestrates a data plane (Source, Encoder Workers, Packager). Kafka carries pipeline telemetry. Encoder workers push segments to Packager via HTTP. The system uses layered failover: local FFmpeg supervisor, heartbeat timeout, and K8s restart.

**Tech Stack:** Go, ConnectRPC + Protobuf (Buf CLI), Kafka (twmb/franz-go), MongoDB (official driver), FFmpeg + H.264, HLS (RFC 8216), Vite + React + hls.js, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Docker Compose, Helm, OpenTofu

## Progress Tracker

| Epic | File | Status | Milestone |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | `01-foundation.md` | DONE | `buf generate` works, `docker compose up` starts infra |
| 2 | `02-encoding-pipeline.md` | IN PROGRESS | Segments on disk, events in Kafka |
| 3 | `03-packaging-playback.md` | TODO | BBB plays in hls.js page |
| 4 | `04-stream-manager.md` | TODO | ConnectRPC call starts stream end-to-end |
| 5 | `05-pipeline-controller.md` | TODO | Kill encoder → controller recovers |
| 6 | `06-api-dashboard.md` | TODO | Full end-to-end in dashboard |
| 7 | `07-observability-infra.md` | TODO | Metrics, tracing, Helm, OpenTofu |
| 8 | `08-abr-polish.md` | TODO | Multi-rendition, CI, docs |

**Epics are sequential** — each builds on the previous.

## Decisions & Conventions

### Coding Standards: CLAUDE.md
All Go coding conventions (config structs, logger scoping, code hygiene) are documented in `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root. That file is the single source of truth — do not duplicate here.

### Kafka: franz-go (not segmentio/kafka-go)
`twmb/franz-go` with `kfake` for in-memory test clusters. Constructors accept config structs (`ProducerConfig`, `ConsumerConfig`).

### Logging: Zap (not slog)
One root `*zap.Logger` in `main()`, injected via config structs. Constructors scope with `.Named("component").With(...)`. Methods add `zap.String("method", "name")` as a field. `zap.NewNop()` for tests. Nil logger defaults to `zap.NewNop()` in constructors. Already implemented in `internal/logging/logging.go`.

### Secrets: Proton Pass CLI
Use `pass-cli run --env-file .env.template -- <cmd>` when real secrets are needed. Go code reads `os.Getenv()` — zero code changes. Only needed when real credentials enter (e.g., AWS in Epic 7).

### Database Migrations: golang-migrate
`github.com/golang-migrate/migrate` with MongoDB driver. JSON migration files in `migrations/`. Pattern: `NNNNNN_description.up.json` / `NNNNNN_description.down.json`.

### Frontend Codegen: Connect-ES v2
Single `protoc-gen-es` plugin, `target=ts`. Plain TypeScript types (not classes). `create(Schema, {...})` pattern.

### Docker Compose Ports
MongoDB is mapped to **host port 27018** (not default 27017) to avoid conflicts with other local MongoDB instances. All services connecting to MongoDB on `localhost` must use port 27018. Kafka is on 9092, Prometheus on 9090, Grafana on 3001.

### GitHub Username
`alexrybrown` — already set in `go.mod` as `github.com/alexrybrown/streamline`.

## Notes for Implementer

1. **FFmpeg must be installed** — `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or `brew install ffmpeg`
2. **Go 1.22+** recommended
3. **Docker must be running** for Docker Compose and testcontainers
4. **TDD everywhere** — write failing test → implement → verify pass → commit
5. **Code in plan is a starting point, not gospel** — adapt per CLAUDE.md conventions
6. **Commit after every story** — intermediate commits within stories are fine too
